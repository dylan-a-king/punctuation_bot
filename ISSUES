Issue 0:
    On first running after install, program crashes because discord token is not
    available in .env. If no discord token is found in .env, or no .env is found,
    ask the user for the token and auto-create the .env.

Issue 1: SOLVED 
    The system surrounding embeds and GIFs is broken. It can
    skip *any message* with embeds, and only sometimes does
    so. Ideally, only messages that are URL-only and have 
    embeds should be skipped.

Issue 2: SOLVED
    When I recieve edits, I assume that they've happened after i've had time
    to respond to the message. this isn't always the case. Catch instances of
    messages with pending replies being edited/deleted.

Issue 3: SOLVED
    Code duplication in on_delete and on_edit. Deletes should be treated as edits
    where the after_message is `None`.
